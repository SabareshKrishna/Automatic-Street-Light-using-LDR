# 🌙 Automatic Street Light using LDR

This project demonstrates an automatic street light system that turns ON in the absence of light and turns OFF when ambient light is detected — using an LDR and transistor-based circuit. It is ideal for beginners in electronics and automation.

## 🛠️ Components Used
- LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)
- NPN Transistor (BC547)
- LED
- Resistors (10kΩ, 330Ω)
- Breadboard and Wires
- 9V Power Supply

## ⚙️ Working Principle
- **Daylight** → LDR resistance is low → Transistor OFF → LED OFF  
- **Darkness** → LDR resistance is high → Transistor ON → LED ON

## 🖥️ Simulation
This project was simulated using [Tinkercad Circuits](https://www.tinkercad.com/).
